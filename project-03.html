        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <span>This project involved configuring a small network that connects multiple devices 
            to a web server. The aim was to simulate a scenario where various devices within a 
            local area network (LAN) access a website hosted on an internal server. The simulation 
            also tests the flow of traffic between these devices and how the network facilitates 
            efficient communication.
        </span>

        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <span>The primary challenge was setting up a functional and secure network that allows 
            seamless communication between devices and the web server. Key aspects included 
            assigning the correct IP addresses, ensuring that routers and switches were properly 
            configured, and troubleshooting any connectivity issues. Managing traffic to the web 
            server without overwhelming network resources was also critical.
        </span>

        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <span
          >I started by designing the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, 
          including routers, switches, a web server, and multiple PCs. Each device 
          was assigned an IP address, and the router was configured to handle data 
          traffic between the different network segments.
          <br/><br/>
          The web server was set up to host a simple webpage that could be accessed 
          by any device on the network. Once the configuration was complete, I conducted 
          a series of tests to verify the connectivity between the devices and the server. 
          These included ping tests and HTTP requests to confirm that the web server was 
          reachable and the network behaved as expected</span>

        <h4>The Outcome</h4>
        <span
          >The network was successfully configured, allowing all devices to access the web 
          server and retrieve the hosted content. The simulation demonstrated the effective 
          management of network traffic and the reliability of the configuration in handling 
          basic web requests within a local network. Additionally, troubleshooting exercises 
          enhanced the robustness of the setup, ensuring that potential issues like IP conflicts 
          or routing errors were resolved.

        <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
        <p>
          This project reinforced essential networking concepts such as IP addressing, routing, 
          and the importance of proper device configuration. I also gained experience in 
          troubleshooting common network issues and ensuring seamless connectivity in a controlled 
          environment. Working with Packet Tracer further honed my ability to simulate real-world 
          network scenarios.

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
            I’m proud of this project as it demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and 
            troubleshoot a functional network. It also showcases my foundational skills in networking, 
            which are critical for cybersecurity roles. In the future, I would look to incorporate more 
            advanced security measures, such as firewalls and access control lists (ACLs), to simulate 
            a more secure network environment.
