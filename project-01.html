        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <span
          >As a designer and wed developer, i created my personal portfolio
          website with the goal of showcasing my skills. The project serves as
          both a creative outlet and a professional tool to highlight my
          experties in building user-centric and visually apealing websites.
        </span>

        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <span
          >The main challenge of the project involved finding a font that
          metched the original design i created in Adobe XD. I could not find
          the exact font that i used in the design for web use, so i had to
          search for an alternative font that closely resembled it, ensuring
          that the final product stayed true to my initial vision.

      <div class="contents">
        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <span
          >The project started with planning and wireframing in Adobe XD, where
          I conceptualized the look and feel of the website. My focus was on a
          clean, modern design that would allow visitors to easily navigate my
          portfolio. Once the design was set, I began coding the site using
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure responsiveness and interactive
          elements. <br /><br />
          Throughout the development process, I hosted my project on GitHub,
          utilizing version control to track my progress and maintain an
          organized workflow. Testing across different browsers and devices was
          crucial to ensure a consistent user experience.</span
        >

        <h4>The Outcome</h4>
        <span
          >The completed website not only showcases my skills but also serves as
          a testament to my ability to balance aesthetics with functionality.
          Visitors can easily explore my work, read about my expertise, and
          connect with me for potential opportunities. The responsive design
          ensures an optimized experience across all devices, from desktops to
          mobile phones. <br /><br />

        <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
        <p>
          This project reinforced my ability to find creative solutions,
          particularly in font matching, and deepened my experience in front-end
          development. It also highlighted the importance of maintaining a
          user-centric approach in design while keeping technical functionality
          in mind.

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          I am proud of how the website turned out, as it represents not only my
          skillset but also my passion for creating engaging and user-friendly
          digital experiences. In future projects, I would continue refining the
          user journey and further explore interactive elements to enhance the
          website’s engagement.
